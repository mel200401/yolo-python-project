# yolo-python-project
this project uses the YOLO algorithm for object detection using PyTorch.  

Preprocessing (Melissa) 
until Tuesday 

Model (I-Chun) 
from Tuesday/Wednesday

Visualization (Sara) 
after Wednesday

--> try to find some papers to understand what has to go into the report 

--> check the requirements 
--> After that divide parts of report to write 



Introduction: (Sara)

- RQ: What are the advantages yolo? 
- traffic detection relevance, object detection algorithms (also autonomous driving)
- Methodology: - details about comparison

Methods:  (theory of object detection ,why choose yolo in comparison, important: which methods/libraries/packages are being used)
- Preprocessing (Meli)
- Model (I-chun)
- Visualization (Sara)

Data Description:  
- dataset (Meli)

Building Model:
- Preprocessing (Meli)
- Model (I-chun)
- Visualization (Sara)

Conclusion: (I-chun)
- vision transformer maybe higher quality output but more requirements for the dataset
- yolo better for small scale projects
-  Compare with other published works and detail anyshortcomings of your work!
